# OpenAI API Client Library in Swift

This is a wrapper library to access OpenAI HTTP API's. The full API docs can be found here:
https://beta.openai.com/api-docs

## Installation üíª

### Manual

Copy source files into your own project

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)

You can use Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in your Package.swift file or by adding directly within Xcode

.Package(url: "https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift.git", majorVersion: 1)

## Example Usage ü§©

Import the module in your application.

import OpenAISwift

Set your API token from creating one here.

`let openAPI = OpenAISwift(authToken: "TOKEN")`

Create a call to the completions API, passing in the text prompt and the specific data model to be used.

openAPI.sendCompletion(with: "A random emoji", model: "text-davinci-003") { result, error in
    if let error {
        print("We have an error \(error)")
    }
            
if let result {
    print(result.choices.first?.text ?? "")
    }
}

The API will return an OpenAPI object containing the responding text items.

## Contribute ‚ù§Ô∏è

I created this mainly for fun, we can add more endpoints and explore the library even further. Feel free to raise a PR to help grow the library.
